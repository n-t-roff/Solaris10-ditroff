    Any version of roff (e.g. UNIX V7) does count \} as a macro
    argument regarding \n(.$.  This makes \n(.$ rather random if
    you cannot force users to put \} on a separate line *or* to
    put it behind the macro call and substract 1 from \n(.$.  To
    make \n(.$ meaningful again this bug has been fixed now, i.e.
    \} is not considered as a macro argument anymore.

    Very old versions of the mm macros inserted cut marks in the
    document for typesetters which had used endless paper rolls.
    Although they are only of historical significance they had
    never been removed in the Solaris version of mm.  They are
    now switched of (via .rm )k).
